# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Classification-Algorithm
Developed a heart disease prediction system using machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify potential heart conditions at an early stage.

Leveraged medical data mining and classification algorithms to uncover hidden patterns in patient records, enabling accurate prediction and clinical decision support based on historical health data.

Validated the model on a Kaggle dataset with 1,225 instances, demonstrating improved precision and performance compared to existing methodologies, proving its effectiveness in real-world clinical scenarios.
